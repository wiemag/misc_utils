Miscellaneous scripts
---------------------

Small utility bash scripts.
- jpg2pdf.sh     - converting JPEG's into monochrome PDF's
- myip.sh        - external and internal IP plus card interface name
- pdf_cutting.sh - splitting PDF's into smaller PDF's
- signit.sh      - gpg wrapper to make detached gpg signatures

INSTALLATION

No installation of the above scripts is necessary, although using them may require installing some software. For example, 'jpg2pdf.sh' depends on imagemagick, and signit depends on gpg/gpg2.
